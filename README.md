# _**Rock Paper Scissors Game**_

### by _**Cesar Lopez & Karl Starkweather**_

### _February 6, 2022_

#### _Rock Paper Scissors is an ancient and venerable contest for establishing dominance, or a fun children's game, depending on your perspective. This application is meant to compliment the physical play of two users to determine who has won a particular round. (Please note that users must have a hand (left or right) with at least two fingers to play)_

#### Rules Of The Game
_The game is played by 2 people. Each person elects "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" in the terminal.
_Each person chooses at the same time, so that each person doesn't know what the other person has picked.
_If one person chooses "Rock" and the other person picks "Scissors" then "Rock" wins. It's a game of combinations:
```
Rock v. Scissors = Rock wins
Rock v. Paper = Paper wins
Paper v. Scissors = Scissors wins
```
_If both people choose the same thing, then it is a draw and nobody wins.
